# Week 1 

Comment on the personality type identified in the questionnaire.  Discuss the role you hope to play in the team.

In week 1 i took TRP test to figure out what role I would have in the team. The two most prominant roles I got back from the test were diplomat and regulator.
I do agree with the roles the test returned as I believe I am good at communicating with my team about problems we may have and I believe I can be unbiased in group discussions and help resolve any conflicting oppinions or arguments. I also align heavily with the regulator role as I strive for perfection and like to make sure things are in order and properly done.

With this in mind I hope to help the team to communicate more efficiently, resolve any issues and to help the group ensure everything we create is premium and polished aswell as ensuring all deadlines are hit.
