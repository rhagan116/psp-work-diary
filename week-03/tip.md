# Week 3 Approach To Sprint Week

This week we created story points for the project in order to determine what exactly we will need to do and how difficult we think it will be to do. In order to decide how difficult we thought a task would be we used post it notes and wrote a number based on how difficult the task would be, we all put them in the middle of the table at the same time and took the average.
