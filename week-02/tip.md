Having looked through the project brief with my team, we gathered some questions to ask the client, with the answer's we got we have a better understanding of what the client wants and have managed to forumlate our MoSCoW document.

# Tools
We have created a discord server for communicating/organising meetings, for sharing files and collaborating we will have a git hub repo for us all to use.
