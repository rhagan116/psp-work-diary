# Day 1 
# Objectives for the day 
My objectives today were to work on the apex cornering algoirthm using the racing lines. And to improve the current steering algorithm
and incorporate the racing lines within this.

# What I completed
I made progress on developing the apex cornering algorithm and managed to create a function that can return an ideal track position for 
the car based on how far it is into the corner. I breifly started the steering algorithm aswell but it needs work.

# What I will do tommorow 
Tommorow I will polish the apex cornering and aim to get a working version of the steering integrated with the apex cornering logic
